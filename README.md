# A Benchmark Study for the Assessment of Global Horizontal Irradiation using SVR and BRR
Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) Prediction using the concepts of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, Cross-Validation (CV) to evaluate a model's interpretability, based on Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR).

### ◘ Introduction
Solar irradiance is the amount of power per unit area (surface power density) that is received from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range of the measuring device. 
The radiation reaching the earth's surface can be represented in a number of different ways. Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is the total amount of shortwave radiation received from above by a surface horizontal to the ground. It is important to point out that the sum can be correctly acquired after accounting for the solar zenith angle of the Sun z and diffuse horizontal irradiance:

```
GHI = DHI + DNI × cos ⁡ ( z ) 
```

The Irradiance can be observed and measured at the Earth's surface after atmospheric absorption and scattering and therefore, is a function of distance from the Sun, the solar cycle, and cross-cycle changes in space. The predominant advantages for the study and measuring the irradiance are the prediction of energy generation from solar power plants to better strategize the power consumption, the heating and cooling loads of buildings, climate modeling and weather forecasting, passive daytime radiative cooling applications, and space travel.
